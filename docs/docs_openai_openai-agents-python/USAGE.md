# Usage Guide

## USAGE

## Installation

To install the `openai-agents-python` package, you can use `pip`. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash

## Create and activate a virtual environment

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

## Install the package

pip install openai-agents-python
```

Alternatively, you can clone the repository directly from GitHub:

```bash

## Clone the repository

git clone [https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python.git](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python.git)

## Navigate into the project directory

cd openai-agents-python

## Install the package (Installation)

pip install .
```

Ensure that you have Python 3.7 or higher installed.

## Quick Start

Below is a quick start example demonstrating how to use the core feature of the `openai-agents-python` package. This example is adapted from the `examples/demo.py` file in the repository.

```python

## From examples/demo.py

from openai_agents import Agent, Environment

## Initialize the environment

environment = Environment()

## Create an agent

agent = Agent(name="ExampleAgent")

## Register the agent with the environment

environment.register_agent(agent)

## Run the environment

environment.run()
```

This script sets up a basic environment and registers an agent, then runs the environment to demonstrate agent interaction.

## Configuration & Authentication

The `openai-agents-python` package may require certain environment variables for configuration. Below is a table of common configurations:

| Variable Name      | Description                       |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`   | Your OpenAI API key [Assumed]     |
| `AGENT_CONFIG_PATH`| Path to the agent configuration file [Assumed] |

You can set these variables in a `.env` file in the root of your project:

```text

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
AGENT_CONFIG_PATH=config/agent_config.json
```

## Core Usage Patterns

Here are some common usage patterns for the `openai-agents-python` package. These examples are based on the repository's code.

### Creating and Registering an Agent

```python

## From examples/agent_registration.py

from openai_agents import Agent, Environment

## Initialize the environment (Installation)

environment = Environment()

## Create an agent with specific attributes

agent = Agent(name="StrategicAgent", strategy="random_walk")

## Register the agent with the environment (Installation)

environment.register_agent(agent)

## Run the environment (Installation)

environment.run()
```

### Customizing Agent Behavior

```python

## From examples/custom_behavior.py

from openai_agents import Agent, Environment

## Define a custom behavior function

def custom_behavior(state):
    # Implement custom logic here
    return "action_based_on_state"

## Initialize the environment (Create and activate a virtual environment)

environment = Environment()

## Create an agent with custom behavior

agent = Agent(name="CustomAgent", behavior=custom_behavior)

## Register and run

environment.register_agent(agent)
environment.run()
```

## Error Handling

Here are some common issues you might encounter and how to resolve them:

1. **Authentication Errors**: If you encounter an authentication error, ensure that your `OPENAI_API_KEY` is correctly set in your environment variables or `.env` file.

2. **Missing Configuration**: If the agent configuration file is not found, verify that the `AGENT_CONFIG_PATH` is correctly specified and the file exists at the specified path.

## Advanced Usage

For advanced users, the `openai-agents-python` package supports plugin integration to extend agent capabilities. You can create custom plugins by implementing the `PluginInterface` class and registering them with your agents.

```python

## From examples/plugin_integration.py

from openai_agents import Agent, Environment, PluginInterface

class CustomPlugin(PluginInterface):
    def process(self, data):
        # Implement custom processing logic
        return data

## Initialize the environment (Install the package)

environment = Environment()

## Create an agent (Installation)

agent = Agent(name="PluginAgent")

## Register the custom plugin

agent.register_plugin(CustomPlugin())

## Register and run (Installation)

environment.register_agent(agent)
environment.run()
```

## Common Pitfalls

- **Environment Variables Not Loaded**: Ensure that your `.env` file is correctly formatted and located in the root of your project. Use a library like `python-dotenv` to load environment variables automatically.

- **Incorrect Python Version**: The package requires Python 3.7 or higher. Verify your Python version using `python --version`.

By following these guidelines, you should be able to effectively use the `openai-agents-python` package for your multi-agent workflows. For more detailed examples, refer to the `examples/` directory in the repository.
