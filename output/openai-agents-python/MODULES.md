## Project Architecture

The `openai-agents-python` repository is organized to facilitate the development and demonstration of multi-agent workflows using a lightweight and powerful framework. The codebase is structured into several key directories, each serving a distinct purpose:

- **`docs/`**: Contains documentation scripts and markdown files that provide guidance and examples for using the framework.
- **`examples/`**: Houses a variety of example implementations showcasing different agent patterns and capabilities.
- **`src/`**: The core source code of the framework, implementing the main functionalities.
- **`tests/`**: Contains test cases to ensure the reliability and correctness of the framework.

## Core Modules

### `src/`

The `src/` directory is the heart of the framework, containing the core modules that implement the primary functionalities of the multi-agent system. Unfortunately, specific files within this directory are not listed, but generally, this would include:

- **Purpose and Responsibility**: Implements the core logic for managing and executing multi-agent workflows.
- **Key Classes/Functions**: Would typically include classes for agent management, workflow orchestration, and communication protocols.
- **Example Usage**: Example usage would be found in the `examples/` directory, demonstrating how to instantiate and utilize these core classes.
- **Dependencies**: Likely depends on standard Python libraries and possibly third-party libraries for networking or asynchronous processing.

## Helper/Utility Modules

### `docs/scripts/translate_docs.py`

- **Purpose and Responsibility**: A utility script for translating documentation files, possibly to support multiple languages.
- **Key Classes/Functions**: Functions for reading, translating, and writing documentation files.
- **Example Usage**: Not explicitly provided, but usage would involve running the script with appropriate input and output file paths.
- **Dependencies**: May depend on translation libraries or APIs.

## Module Relationships

The modules within the `openai-agents-python` repository interact primarily through the core framework in the `src/` directory. The `examples/` directory provides practical implementations and demonstrations of how the core functionalities can be applied in real-world scenarios. The `docs/` directory supports users in understanding and utilizing the framework effectively.

- **Core to Examples**: The examples depend on the core modules to demonstrate various agent patterns and capabilities.
- **Docs to Core/Examples**: Documentation scripts may reference both core and example modules to generate comprehensive guides.

## Extension Points

The framework is designed to be extensible, allowing users to customize and extend its capabilities:

- **Agent Patterns**: Users can create new agent patterns by extending existing classes or implementing new ones in the `examples/agent_patterns/` directory.
- **Tool Integration**: The framework can be extended to integrate additional tools or services, enhancing the agents' capabilities.
- **Custom Workflows**: Developers can define custom workflows by leveraging the core modules and extending their functionalities.

By organizing the codebase into distinct directories and providing comprehensive examples, the `openai-agents-python` repository supports both novice and advanced users in developing sophisticated multi-agent workflows.
